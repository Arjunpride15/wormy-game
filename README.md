Hi people!
This is a game, made with Python and Pygame.
For info on Python, go to www.python.org
For info on Pygame, go to www.pygame.org
This game is a Nibbles clone. The player starts controling a short worm using the up, down, left or right keys. The worm has to eat an apple. Each time the worm eats the apple, it gets bigger and the game gets tougher.
Hope you enjoy the game!
